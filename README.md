<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86917304/167479709-ca8c8be4-fa1c-412c-849d-5fe9fc642cea.png)




* As non-governmental organizations continue to work towards the betterment of society, one of the key challenges they face is setting up and managing their online communities. While the digital world offers many opportunities for attracting and retaining volunteers, NGOs still face a number of issues. They are forced to compete for attention against ads, memes, and other media on social media platforms.

* Also, most organizations do not have a streamlined platform which leaves them with no way to interact with volunteers. Some even choose third-party tools, software, or platforms to host their online presence which may deter potential volunteers as they may not wish to sign up on unfamiliar platforms for fear of data breaches.

* We aim to create a platform that allows NGOs to sign up and create their own dashboards which showcase their work. Potential volunteers will be able to filter listed NGOs on the basis of their location and domain of work and will then be able to get in touch with their preferred organizations. This will simplify the recruitment process and will help NGOs to gain more reach and visibility and hence lead to a better future.
